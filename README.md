## Description
This app is a Form consiting of: 
* A greeting heading "Hello"
* Input: First Name
* Input: Last Name
* Input: Email 
* Submit Button (deactivated)

The inputs provided by the user will be rendered and updated independently:
* The Heading will greet the user using the First Name and Last Name provided in the From.
* A new Paragraph will be rendered whe nthe user provides the input email in the From.

## Notes:

This form is similar to the one created in the repo [React: Complex State - Form](https://github.com/ChristianVillalba/react_changing_complex_state__form.git)      
The differences are:
* New element added: email
* The function ```handleContactChange``` uses Object Destructuring

## What I have learned with this project:
* Storing Objects in useState
* Managing state (JS Objects)
	* JS Objects
	* Use previous states
* React Forms
* Handling Events
* Object Destructuring
